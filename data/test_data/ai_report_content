Overview Below is a summary of the settings for your project: Trusted AI A lack of accessibility to the tools and insights that help you validate models are one of the major barriers to building trust in an AI solution. DataRobot believes that trust is integral to every aspect of machine learning use cases. By providing a platform that delivers AI for all, DataRobot levels the playing field and democratizes trust in machine learning. DataRobot rigorously evaluates and tests every machine learning model it builds against 14 major dimensions of trust. These dimensions range across three major categories — performance, operations, and ethics: This report highlights insights from your modeling project that fall under three critical dimensions of Trusted AI: Data Quality, Accuracy, and Interpretability. You can return to your project to further investigate other dimensions of trust that DataRobot delivers with each model run. Data Quality: Dataset Details The first insight falls under the Data Quality dimension of trust. Developing a trusted AI solution begins with understanding your data. DataRobot analyzed the dataset you used for model building and found: 594 rows of data 2 features, including the binary target "visible" a positive class value of "yes"  a negative class value of "no"  DataRobot identified 2 features, all of which were determined to be "informative." DataRobot did not detect any features with low information (for example, duplicate columns, a column of all ones, a feature with too few values, etc.). The informative features have the following feature types: Read about data types, visualizations, and transformations in DataRobot's documentation:  Accuracy: Top Performing Model Accuracy is the primary metric used to evaluate model performance. DataRobot makes it easy to evaluate model accuracy by first suggesting metrics that are appropriate for your data and specific use case. The Leaderboard then allows you to compare multiple models and by their prediction accuracy. Based on cross-validation scores, DataRobot determined that the most accurate model for your project "animals.csv" is , "RandomForest Classifier (Gini)" which is based on blueprint : Read more about accuracy and optimization metrics in DataRobot's documentation:  Interpretability: Feature Impact for the Top Performing Model Each DataRobot model includes insights that help to interpret and explain what drives a model’s predictions. This graphic, the Feature Impact visualization, shows the relative importance of features considered most important by the model and provides insights into which features are driving model decisions.  For , the Feature Impact chart shows that the most important feature for accurately predicting values for the target "visible" is animal. Read more about Feature Impact in DataRobot's documentation:  Next Steps This report provides summary information for the top performing model that DataRobot built from your data. It highlights some basic insights across three dimensions of trust, including an overview of your data, the cross validation score that was used to rank the top performing model, and a visualization representing the features that drive model decisions. These insights are just a starting point in understanding the Trusted AI that DataRobot can deliver to your organization.
